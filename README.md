# Naive Bayes
Examples of Naive Bayes classification workflows

This repository is meant to provide an example of implementing a Naive Bayes algorithm in R.  
We will predict whether or not someone makes over $50k per year using the Census data.  
Then we will predict the author of Victorian era text using Naive Bayes along with natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

**Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier that assumes independence between the features. Predictions are based on the historic probabilities.

## Getting Started

You can access the data in the UCI Machine Learning repository (linked below) by following along with the R code.     
[Census Test](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test)  
[Census Train](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data)  
[Victorian Authors](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00217/C50.zip)

Alternatively, you can save the files in this repository to your working directory to follow along:  
("Census_Train.csv", "Census_Test.csv", and "C50.zip").
  
If using this code within R Studio, collapse all sections by pressing Alt + O for easier navigation between sections.
